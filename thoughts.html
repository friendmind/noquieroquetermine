            You said we haven't been friends for long. And you're right. There is so much
            we don't know about each other. I have learned a lot about you the last couple 
            of weeks and I have opened up in ways I haven't before. But I know there is still 
            a lot for us to learn about each other. So the following might be a shock to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your reaction to what I said scared me. And I found that weird and confusing. 
            You have been kind to me in all the best ways and yet your reaction to what I did
            caused that emotion in me. Of course, this feeling stems from something beyond you. You did
            nothing except speak your mind and let me know how you felt, something I am glad you did.
            Needless to say, what I felt was out of your control and my doing. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I won't say much about this as this is something I have to work on and is not your problem. 
            What I can and will say is that I found your reassurance to put my mind at ease. So thank you for that. I sometimes think 
            things and need reassurance, which I had not realized.
        </p>
            <p>

            Moving away from that...I know I have already apologized and you've forgiven me. 
            Despite that, I still want you to know that I hope my words did not stick or sting. But if they did I am sorry. 
            
            <br><br>
            Also, you might think all this was not necessary. And I honestly have no idea if you're right
            or not but I felt that I needed to do this. If not for you, for me. I suppose this is my way of trying to explain 
            or get something across. If you don't like it you can let me know.        
        </p>

            in knowing regarding me. Just click on the following link.
