            It's been a while. It honestly feels like weeks since we haven't
            spoken. It might just be me though, I don't know. I have made this 
            website in hopes of breaking the silence because I know that if I 
            do not say something I will withdraw completely and I do not want that.
            But don't worry, I will make this short and concise as possible.
            <br><br>
            I had wanted to reach out to you but I couldn't let myself do so.
            I felt as if I did not have the right to do that. I believed
            it was best if I did not take the initiative because I tend to read the 
            room wrong with these things. So I waited. And I am glad I did. During 
            this waiting period I realized something about myself that I had not captured before. 
            <br><br>
            The last time we hung out we talked about the uncertainty of people. How if there was a way to know how someone is really like to save yourself
            the potential hurt. I don't think we can ever be sure. We can see or pick up 
            things but everything is a risk. We just have to be willing to go for it despite
            the fear, nervousness or uncertainty it contains. Because we never know what good lies ahead if we don't
            simply give it a shot. 
            <br><br>
            So here's me trying just that. I'm not very good with these things but I am more than
            willing to get this right if you allow it. The following are some stuff I would like you
            to know. I hope it is not too much. Just know I mean this with good intentions, nothing more.
            Enjoy my mini project&#128036;
